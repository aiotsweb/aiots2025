        <p class="text-justify">
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) has received a lot of attention recently, especially for the success of deep learning in addressing problems that were considered hard before. Big players, such as Google, Amazon, and Baidu, are exploring the application of AI in different markets, including healthcare, FinTech, and autonomous vehicles. Together with AI, technologies like Internet-of-Things (IoT) have boosted the emerging Industry 4.0, where through the adoption of the Industrial-IoT (IIoT) into the production chain, companies want smarter manufacturing that can be adapted to their customers’ needs.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            The accelerating digitization of new applications brings challenges primarily associated with the cybersecurity of the applications, where confidentiality, integrity, and data availability are crucial. Security incidents in the IIoT impact the safety properties since applications interact physically with people or other assets. The intersection of AI and cybersecurity can be seen as a two-fold relationship. On the one hand, AI techniques can be adopted to improve state-of-the-art security solutions. On the other hand, cybersecurity can contribute to improving the security of AI algorithms through the exploration of adversarial machine learning.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            However, the application of AI in security, particularly within IoT, has not yet achieved the same level of success as in other domains. Despite decades of research, challenges remain in effectively integrating AI for robust security solutions. Notable studies highlight the influence application characteristics have on the feasibility of using machine learning for network intrusion detection and other security services. There is a need to explore which IoT applications are amenable to AI-based security defenses, identifying characteristics of IoT applications that indicate the potential success of AI-based security measures. Additionally, it seeks to challenge popular assumptions in the research literature by reflecting on real-world IoT applications. In the spirit of moving beyond theoretical models, we aim to understand how AI-based security research can be applied practically to enhance the security of IoT systems.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            This workshop aims to open a space where new research ideas from different areas converge into the intersection of AI, IIoT, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), and cybersecurity. We encourage researchers and experts in the fields of AI, embedded systems, CPS, and cybersecurity to take the opportunity to use this workshop to share their work and open the discussion of new ideas on this always-evolving topic.

            <li>Cyber Threat Intelligence for AI and IIoT/CPS</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="submission-guidelines mt-4">
            Submissions must be anonymous, with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgements, or obvious references. Each submission must begin with a title, short abstract, and a list of keywords. The introduction should summarise the contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a non-specialist reader. Likewise, all submissions must follow the original LNCS format (see <a href="http://www.springeronline.com/lncs" target="_blank">http://www.springeronline.com/lncs</a>) with a page limit of 18 pages (including references) for the main part (reviewers are not required to read beyond this limit) and 30 pages in total. It is strongly encouraged that submissions be processed in LaTeX.
        </p>
        <p class="submission-guidelines">
            Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their paper will be presented at the conference and make a full version available online. Therefore, each accepted paper must be presented by a registered author. Submissions not meeting the submission guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.
